# Multilayer Perceptron for the MNIST dataset

In this Jupyter notebook I train two multi layer perceptron models for solving the MNIST digit identification problem.  
- The first model is trained using `Scikit-learn`'s MLPClassifier class.
- The second model is trained using `Tensorflow` and `Keras` as a Sequential model.
  
The notebook is structured into the following parts:  
  
1. Theoretical info about the multilayer perceptron architecture,
  
2. Data preprocessing for the MNIST dataset,
  
3. Skicit-learn model training and experiments,
  
4. TensorFlow model training and experiments,
  
5. Comparing and discussing results.
